# Zoro App – Ecommerce Platform 💼🎓

> This project was developed as part of my internship experience to practice full-stack React development, focusing on frontend design, user experience, and state management.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Zoro App is a responsive eCommerce website I built during my internship. The goal was to simulate a real-world shopping experience where users can browse products, view details, and manage a shopping cart—all built with modern web technologies.

## ✨ Key Features

* Clean and modern UI inspired by real eCommerce platforms
* Fully responsive – works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
* Add items to shopping cart with quantity selection
* View detailed product information
* Cart page updates total price in real-time
* Designed to simulate real-world product browsing and checkout logic

## 🚀 Technologies Used

This project was built using:

* **React.js** (via Create React App)
* **React Router DOM** – for client-side routing
* **React Bootstrap** – for styling and layout
* **Redux Toolkit** – to manage global state (cart functionality)
